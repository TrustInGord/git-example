# Figma Land Spec

Your task is to complete the full design found under `/design`. Do your best to follow best practices discussed in class.

All the assets you need are in this repo.

## The Challenge

Based on `/design/responsive` videos, make sure your typography is `responsive` by using `clamp`.

1. Font: Google Font Open Sans: <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans>

2. Be organized

3. Use external `stylesheets`

4. You must use and understand `CSS Clip Path` [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)

5. Your responsive design should align with previous projects in the class. High quality is expected just as seen from previous projects in this course.

6. Start using `BEM`.

ðŸ˜Ž Happy Coding!

**_NOTE_**: You must use all `CSS` & `HTML` seen so far in the course -> Flexbox, Reponsive Design using only Flexbox, Responsive Images, Background Images, etc. Use margin and padding sparingly as seen in previous projects.
