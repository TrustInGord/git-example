# Project: JavaScript Fundamentals - The Dragon's Lair

Welcome, adventurer! Your quest is to bring a story to life using the fundamental magic of JavaScript. You have been given a set of variables that describe a hero and their world. Your task is to manipulate these variables to unfold a narrative of challenge and triumph.

## Your Objective

Complete the `game.js` file to create a text-based adventure that plays out in the browser console. You must follow one crucial rule:

**⚠️ Do NOT declare any new variables with `let`, `const`, or `var`. You must only use and modify the variables that have already been provided.**

This exercise will test your understanding of:

- Modifying variables.
- Using arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`).
- Using compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`).
- Manipulating and combining strings.
- Using template literals (`` ` ``) to create dynamic text.

## Instructions

Open the `game.js` file and follow the numbered steps. Each step requires you to write a few lines of code to update the hero's stats and build a part of the story.

1. **The Journey Begins:** Start by combining the hero's name and class into a single introduction string.
2. **The Rusty Sword:** The hero finds a sword. You will update the hero's weapon and increase their attack power.
3. **The Troll's Bridge:** To cross a bridge, the hero must pay a toll. You will need to decrease the hero's gold.
4. **The Healing Fountain:** The hero finds a fountain that restores health. You will increase the hero's health, but be careful not to exceed the maximum health.
5. **The Dragon Battle:** The hero battles the dragon! Calculate the damage taken by the hero and update their health.
6. **Victory & Treasure:** The hero defeats the dragon and finds its treasure hoard. Add the treasure to the hero's gold.
7. **The Final Tale:** Combine all the story parts into the final narrative.

## Final Output

When you run your completed `game.js` file (in the browser console or with Node.js), your code should produce this exact output:

```text
STORY OUTPUT:
Our hero, Arthur the Warrior, begins their quest.
They find a Rusty Sword, raising their attack power to 25.
A troll demands a toll of 50 gold to cross a bridge. Arthur has 50 gold left.

The dragon attacks! Arthur takes 60 damage and has 35 health remaining.
VICTORY! The dragon is defeated. Arthur claims the treasure of 150 gold, bringing their total to 200 gold.

--- HERO'S FINAL STATS ---
Health: 35
